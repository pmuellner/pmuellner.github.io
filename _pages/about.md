<!--Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.-->

Peter MÃ¼llner is a researcher and PhD student in the FairAI area of [Know-Center GmbH](https://www.know-center.at/). He obtained a Master's degree in Computer Science from Graz University of Technology in 2019 (Topic: Fair Music Recommendations). Since then, he is pursuing a PhD in Computer Science. His thesis focuses on **user privacy in recommender systems**, in particular on the three questions: 
*How can recommender systems use fewer data to generate meaningful recommendations?
*How can we improve the recommendation accuracy of differentially private recommender systems?
*In which different ways does differential privacy impact personalized recommendations?
