title: "Differential privacy in collaborative filtering recommender systems: a review" 
authors: "Peter Müllner, Elisabeth Lex, Markus Schedl, and Dominik Kowald"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/dpinrecommendersystems
excerpt: "We review 26 recommendation approaches that apply differential privacy, and we highlight research that improves the trade-off between recommendation quality and user privacy. Also, we classify these approaches based on how they apply DP, i.e., to the user representation, the model updates, or after model training. Finally, we discuss open issues of research on differentially private recommender systems, e.g., considering the relation between privacy and fairness, and the users' different needs for privacy".
