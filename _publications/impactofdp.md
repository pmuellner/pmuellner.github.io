excerpt: "We study the impact of Differential Privacy (DP) on recommendation accuracy and popularity bias by comparing recommendation lists generated with and without DP. We find that nearly all users receive different recommendations than without DP and that large parts of the recommendation lists are different. Plus, we observe a substantial drop in recommendation accuracy and a sharp increase in popularity bias. Furthermore, especially user groups that prefer unpopular items experience a substantial increase in popularity bias when DP is applied."
