excerpt: "The utilization of user data for generating recommendations can pose severe threats to user privacy, e.g., the inadvertent leakage of user data to untrusted parties or other users. Instead of the plain application of privacy-enhancing techniques, which could lead to decreased accuracy, we tackle the problem itself, i.e., the utilization of user data. With this, we aim to equip recommender systems with means to provide high-quality recommendations that respect users’ privacy."

Recommender systems process abundances of user data to generate recommendations that fit well to each individual user. This utilization of user data can pose severe threats to user privacy, e.g., the inadvertent leakage of user data to untrusted parties or other users. Moreover, this data can be used to reveal a user’s identity, or to infer very private information as, e.g., gender. Instead of the plain application of privacy-enhancing techniques, which could lead to decreased accuracy, we tackle the problem itself, i.e., the utilization of user data. With this, we aim to equip recommender systems with means to provide high-quality recommendations that respect users’ privacy.
